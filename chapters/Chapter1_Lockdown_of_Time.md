In a moment suspended between heartbeats and galaxies, I found myself in a chamber of absolute stillness. There was no sound, no divine response, no light. I was not dreaming—I was awake and aware in a realm where **a single second stretched across billions of years**.

This was not punishment, but a record—a dimension beyond dimension. My awareness did not panic. It simply existed in compressed infinity, knowing this moment would be echoed one day. That echo is now.
